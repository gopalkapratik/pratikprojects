 
ðŸŒŸ Infections & Skin Diseases: Diagnosis and Targeted Treatment
Your skin is your bodyâ€™s first line of defense. When infections strike, timely and accurate diagnosis followed by the right treatment is essential for rapid recovery and prevention of complications. We specialize in the comprehensive care of fungal, bacterial, and viral skin infections using evidence-based protocols and advanced diagnostics.
 
ðŸ”¬ Common Skin Infections We Treat
1. Fungal Infections
Types:
Tinea (ringworm, athleteâ€™s foot, jock itch, scalp infection)
Candidiasis (yeast infection of skin folds, nails, mouth)
Symptoms:
Redness, itching, peeling, scaling, circular rashes, soreness in moist areas.
Diagnosis:
Clinical examination
KOH prep, fungal cultures, dermoscopy
Treatment:
Topical or oral antifungal medications
Skin barrier repair and hygiene advice
 
2. Bacterial Infections
Types:
Impetigo (highly contagious, often in children)
Cellulitis, folliculitis, boils
Symptoms:
Pus-filled lesions, crusting, redness, swelling, fever (in severe cases)
Diagnosis:
Visual inspection
Swab cultures for antibiotic sensitivity
Blood tests (if systemic signs)
Treatment:
Topical or oral antibiotics
Proper wound care and hygiene education
 
3. Viral Infections
Types:
Herpes Simplex (cold sores, genital herpes)
Molluscum Contagiosum (common in children and immunocompromised adults)
Warts (caused by HPV)
Symptoms:
Painful blisters, grouped vesicles (herpes), pearly papules (molluscum), rough bumps (warts)
Diagnosis:
Clinical signs
Tzanck smear, PCR tests, dermoscopy
Treatment:
Antiviral creams or tablets
Cryotherapy, laser therapy for molluscum and warts
Recurrence prevention and immune support
 
âœ… Our Diagnostic Approach
We believe in precision medicine:
Dermatologist consultation with clinical evaluation
Skin scrapings/swabs for lab tests
Microscopy, cultures, PCR, or biopsies as needed
Custom treatment plans based on type, severity, and recurrence history
 
ðŸ’Š Management Protocols
Infection Type
First-line Treatment
Advanced/Severe Case Management
Fungal
Topical antifungals (azoles, allylamines)
Oral antifungals, hygiene protocols
Bacterial
Topical antibiotics (mupirocin)
Oral antibiotics, abscess drainage
Viral
Topical antivirals
Oral antivirals, cryotherapy, immune modulators
 
ðŸ”„ Pros & Cons of Treatments
Treatment Type
Pros
Cons
Topical medications
Non-invasive, localized treatment
Requires consistent application, slower effect in deeper infections
Oral medications
Faster relief, effective for severe infections
Risk of side effects (GI upset, liver function impact)
Cryotherapy/Laser
Fast removal of lesions (molluscum, warts)
May cause temporary discomfort, scarring risk
Antiviral therapy
Reduces outbreak frequency, speeds healing
Does not cure herpes; long-term use may be needed
Culture & Sensitivity Testing
Targeted antibiotic use, avoids resistance
Time-consuming, additional cost
